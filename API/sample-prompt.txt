This is the sample graph data  model that we have created for our company. 

(:Company)-[:EMPLOYS]->(:Employee)
(:Employee)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(:Technology)
(:Company)-[:USES]->(:Technology)
(:Project)-[:USES]->(:Technology)
(:Project)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Company)
(:Employee)-[:WORKS_ON]->(:Project)

Based on this graph database model, I need you to convert the prompt that I provided into a cypher query.

prompt: Who are the employees knows Azure?
